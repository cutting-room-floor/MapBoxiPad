= Introduction =

TouchHTTPD is a Cocoa HTTP server designed to be embedded in Cocoa applications.

= Current Features =

 * Standalone.
 * CFNetwork based.
 * Uses CFHTTPMessage
 * Default run mode is single threaded with all connections being served by the current run loop. This keeps things simple for apps with basic needs. Will be adding support for multithreaded servers soon (NSOperation FTW).
 * Optional bonjour service advertising and port allocation.
 * Selector/target style routing of HTTP requests to response handlers.
 * Uses libnatpmp to automatically open ports on AirPort networks.
 * Sample code is a webpage serving up your iSight pictures.
